# Wait N seconds for the check command to execute. The timeout must be
# lower than the interval. If the timeout is reached the service is assumed
# down and the process of withdrawing the route begins.

# down. If this is set to 5, the service must fail 5 health checks before the
# route will be withdrawn.

# Log location. This must be a full path to a file. If the file does not exist
